<h2>History of Drupalaton</h2>
<p>This is the third time in a row that fellow Hungarian drupalists are organizing a camp at this beautiful place. Previous events were using Hungarian as a working language, last year we had some 50 Drupal geeks from all around Hungary and the neighbourhood. Each event was a huge success, participants were barely willing to leave the camp after the wonderful time they had together.</p>
